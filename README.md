There is no more room for war. The ancient game of Gomoku will determine the fate of the Yellow River base. With their futures on the line, the tenacious King Wu and the strong Shang royal family square off. The award? authority over the territory that is the source of power. Pick your side because this is fate, not just a game. Your king will give you ten percent of the land you battled for if you assist him in declaring victory. Everything is in your hands, and the planet is on the brink.
Following are the rules of the game:
1) To win be the first one to connect 5 of your pieces in a row.
2) Once you placed your token doesnt mean that you captured that sector permanently, u might loose the sector, regain it.

                                              Let the war begin
